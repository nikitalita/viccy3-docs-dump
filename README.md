# viccy3-dumps

## CSV
This is where useful dumps of the Object Inspector go; it mostly duplicates what is available in the docs-logs, but it's much easier to parse and sort

## docs-logs
The output of the "dump documentation to logs" command; easily readable

## info
The info files contained in the game's data; these have schema of certain objects and explanations as to what each member value does.
